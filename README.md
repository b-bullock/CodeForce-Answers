This repository contains my personal collection of **Codeforces problem solutions** that I’ve solved myself.  
It serves as a central place to **store**, **organize**, and **review** my competitive programming answers — including explanations, approaches, and clean code implementations in multiple languages.

---

## 📘 Overview

### 🛠️ Languages Used
- 🐍 Python (Primary)
- 💻 C++ (Sometimes)
- ☕ Java (Rarely)

### 🎯 Goals
- Keep a structured record of all Codeforces problems I’ve solved  
- Improve algorithmic thinking and speed  
- Provide clean, understandable solutions for reference  

### 🚀 Future Plans
- Add time/space complexity analysis  
- Add problem tags and difficulty filters  
- Possibly link to blog explanations for trickier problems

## 📂 Repository Structure
```
├── 800/                      # Difficulty level (Codeforces rating)
│   ├── 4A_Watermelon/        # Problem Set
│   │   └── Python/           # Language
│   │       └── 4A.py         # Solution

└── README.md
```

Each folder corresponds to a **difficulty rating** (based on Codeforces).  
File and folder names follow the format:  
`<ProblemID>_<ProblemName>/<Language>/<ProblemID>.ext`

## 💡 Notes
- All solutions are **self-solved** — no copy-paste answers.  
- Occasionally, I’ll include a **short explanation or reasoning** in comments.  
- This repository is mainly for **personal learning and tracking progress**.
