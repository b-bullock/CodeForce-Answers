# [A. Watermelon](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A)

## Problem
One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon.  
They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed **w** kilos.  

They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.  

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that **each of the two parts weighs an even number of kilos**, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal.  
Each of them should get a part of **positive weight**.

## Input
The first (and only) input line contains integer number `w` (**1 ≤ w ≤ 100**) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

## Output
Print `YES` if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; otherwise print `NO`.

## Examples

**Input**  
```8```

**Output**  
```YES```

## Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).
